FIRST, YOU MUST REGISTER.
 THEN, YOU WILL CHOOSE THE CONTINENT 
 WHERE YOU WILL START YOUR MISSION,

BE ASSIGNED TO YOU. YOU WILL BE TRAVELING 
THROUGH DIFFERENT AIRPORTS, TRYING TO CAPTURE 
THE VILLAIN WHO HAS STOLEN SECRET INFORMATION. 
DURING YOUR TRAVELS, YOU MUST KEEP TRACK OF 
YOUR FUEL LEVEL AND ROLL THE DICE 
TO REFUEL WHEN NECESSARY.
ADDITIONALLY, YOU WILL FACE VARIOUS CHALLENGES 
ALONG THE WAY, WHICH WILL BE EXPLAINED TO YOU AS 
YOU PROGRESS. THE VILLAIN ISN'T VERY CLEVER AND WILL 
LEAVE YOU CLUES AT EACH AIRPORT. 
ONE OF THE MAIN OBSTACLES WILL BE THE CONSTANT 
DECREASE IN FUEL, SO YOU MUST BE VERY CAREFUL.

GOOD LUCK, OFFICER!
